What is the pygments-eiffel-lexer?
-----------------

This is a lexer bringing the language Eiffel to Pygments.
Pygments is a Python library for syntax highlighting of a wide variety of programming languages.
For Pygments to know how to highlight which part of a piece of code, it relies on special files to analyze the code structure: a lexer.
So this is a lexer for Eiffel, making it usable with Pygments syntax highlighting.

For more information on Pygments have a look at http://pygments.org/

Installation
-----------------

For you to use the eiffel lexer, you have to add it to your Pygments installation.
For doing so have a look at http://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/#adding-and-testing-a-new-lexer

Usage
-----------------

When the lexer has been added, Pygments will do the rest.

And then?
-----------------

Have fun using it!
Please be aware this lexer is a very basic implementation based on regular expressions and my limited knowledge of
the language Eiffel.
So if you have anything to improve make sure to contribute to this project.
